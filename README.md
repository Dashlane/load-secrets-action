# Dashlane Load Secrets Action

`load-secrets-action` is built using `Dashlane CLI` and `Github Actions`. It allows developers to inject their secrets vault from Dashlane to their Github workflow.

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To setup this action you need a Dashlane account and the Dashlane CLI to be installed on your machine. You can download the Dashlane CLI [here](https://dashlane.github.io/dashlane-cli/install).

**1- Register your device locally**

```sh
dcli devices register "action-name"
```

For more details refer to Dashlane CLI documentation https://dashlane.github.io/dashlane-cli

**2- Set the environment variable prompted by the previous step in your GitHub repositoryâ€™s secrets and variables**

```yml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Load secrets
      id: load_secrets
      uses: ./ # Dashlane/github-action@<version>
      env:
          ACTION_SECRET_PASSWORD: dl://918E3113-CA48-4642-8FAF-CE832BDED6BE/password

          DASHLANE_SERVICE_DEVICE_KEYS: ${{ secrets.DASHLANE_SERVICE_DEVICE_KEYS }}
```

**4- Retrieve your secrets in any next step of your pipeline using `GITHUB_OUTPUT`**
